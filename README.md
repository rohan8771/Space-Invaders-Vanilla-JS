A small JS project. It is an implementation of the classic Space Invaders game. It is just vanilla JS, no 3rd party APIs used. The idea of using a grid (made up of cells which are implemented using divs) and some of the game logic I got from Ania Kub√≥w's "Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games - Full Course" video on freeCodeCamp.org, but the entire code was written by me once I had a direction. 

Currently, the structure isn't the best, and I haven't added comments. Will come back later and do that.
